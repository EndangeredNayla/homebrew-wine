    # Homebrew replaces wine's rpath names with absolute paths, we need to change them back to @rpath relative paths
    # Wine relies on @rpath names to cause dlopen to always return the first dylib with that name loaded into
    # the process rather than the actual dylib found using rpath lookup.
    Dir["#{lib}/wine/{x86_64-unix,x86_32on64-unix}/*.so"].each do |dylib|
      chmod 0664, dylib
      MachO::Tools.change_dylib_id(dylib, "@rpath/#{File.basename(dylib)}")
      MachO.codesign!(dylib)
      chmod 0444, dylib
    end
